# medLLM
This is my ongoing LLM research project with an assistant professor at Clemson University.
My main goal after this project is to better understand AI / LLM Models, as well as create my own and fine-tune GPT models for medical understanding.

11/7/24:
CHAPTER 2 FINISHED, exercises are based on BytePair Encoding (When a word is not in the LLMs vocab, it will parse it into words that are.)
